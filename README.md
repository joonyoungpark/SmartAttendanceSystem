# Smart Attendance System
*Smart Attendance System (SAS)* takes attendance using *facial recognition*, replacing those paper-based traditional attendance sheets. 

## Getting Started
### Requirements
You must run the below commands on the raspberry Pi:
'''
sudo apt-get install boto
sudo apt-get install boto3
sudo apt-get install fswebcam
sudo apt-get install python-pygame
'''
Also consider turning up the volume on your raspberry pi. There is a nice tool to do this called alsamixer.
